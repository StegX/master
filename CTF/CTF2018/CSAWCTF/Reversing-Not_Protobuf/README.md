# Reversing-400pt
## Not Protobuf
I'm in this company's network and I've MITM'd this weird protocol between a dev client and server, but I can't figure out how it works. Connect to 
#### reversing.chal.csaw.io:9002 
and I'll send the client traffic to you. Forward it on to the dev server at 
#### reversing.chal.csaw.io:9001 
to figure out what's going on. Once you're ready, hit up the prod server at 
#### reversing.chal.csaw.io:9000 which should have a flag for you.
