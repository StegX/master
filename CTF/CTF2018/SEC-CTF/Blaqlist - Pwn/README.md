# Blaqlist - Pwn (500)
I found an administration panel but unfortunately it turns out performing bruteforce password guessing over a network is pretty noisy and not they have blacklisted all of our IP addresses. You have 3 attempts to prove you should have access. Good luck. This message will self-destruct.. after the CTF ends.
